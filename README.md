# 📊 Service Status Page

**🌐 Live:** [https://matiastrapaglia.space/status/?token=gaelito2025](https://matiastrapaglia.space/status/?token=gaelito2025)

A lightweight, Python-powered monitoring tool designed to track and display the real-time availability of web services and infrastructure.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project provides a clean and simple dashboard to monitor multiple URLs or services. It automatically checks for uptime and presents the results through a web interface, making it ideal for small teams or personal projects that need transparency on their system's health.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Backend:** [Python](https://www.python.org/) & [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
* **Frontend:** HTML5 & Jinja2 Templates
* **Automation:** Shell Scripting
* **Dependencies:** Managed via `requirements.txt`

## ✨ Key Features

* **Automated Uptime Tracking:** Periodically validates service status via HTTP requests.
* **Security Insights (Firewall Monitoring):** Post-processes system firewall logs to track and visualize blocked connection attempts, helping identify potential threats.
* **Traffic Analysis:** Monitors and summarizes incoming network traffic to provide a clear view of system load and usage patterns.
* **Clean Dashboard:** A minimalist UI to see at a glance service status, security metrics, and traffic data.
* **Lightweight Architecture:** Designed for high efficiency with minimal resource consumption.
* **Resource Performance History:** Tracks and stores historical consumption of system resources (CPU, Memory, I/O) to identify and troubleshoot performance bottlenecks.
* **Bitaxe best-session history:** Persists the miner’s best session difficulty (90‑day retention) and shows it on a log-scale mini chart that only updates when the best diff improves.
* **Internet Stability Monitor (SQLite):** Runs low-speed controlled download probes continuously and stores each sample (speed, HTTP code, duration, errors) in SQLite for incident evidence and dashboard APIs.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* pip (Python package manager)
* Nginx (for production deployment)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/MDTrapaglia/status_page.git](https://github.com/MDTrapaglia/status_page.git)
   cd status_page
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**

   Using the shell script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x run.sh
   ./run.sh
   ```

   Or run it directly with Python:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## 🚀 Production Deployment

The application is configured to run on port 3010 and is served under `/status/` via Nginx reverse proxy.

### Start/Stop Scripts

```bash
# Start the application in background
./scripts/start_all.sh

# Stop the application
./scripts/stop_all.sh

# Check status
./status.sh

# Restart safely
./scripts/stop_all.sh && ./scripts/start_all.sh
# (start_all.sh already stops any existing instance before launching)
```

### Nginx Configuration

The application is served at `https://matiastrapaglia.space/status/` with token authentication.

For details on deploying new applications, see [the deployment guide](docs/agregar-nueva-pagina.md).

## 📦 Data persistence

The app stores lightweight history files alongside the codebase:

- `bitaxe_best_history.jsonl`: best session difficulty snapshots (auto-pruned after 90 days).
- `pi_history_full.jsonl`: long-term Raspberry Pi resource metrics (see Pi charts).
- `session_state.json`: cumulative AxeOS session time tracker.

All of these are ignored by git and refresh automatically during runtime.

## 🌐 Internet stability monitor (SQLite)

This repository now includes `scripts/internet_speed_logger.py`, a continuous low-speed download probe designed to detect ISP instability (drops, intermittent failures, abnormal latency) with durable evidence in SQLite.

### What it records

Each probe is persisted in `data/internet_monitor.db` table `download_samples` with:

- `timestamp_utc`
- `url`
- `limit_rate`
- `range_bytes`
- `speed_bps` / `speed_kbps`
- `time_total_s`
- `http_code`
- `status` (`ok` / `error`)
- `error`
- `curl_exit_code`

### Run manually

```bash
cd /home/mtrapaglia/projects/status_page
python scripts/internet_speed_logger.py
```

Optional env vars:

```bash
MONITOR_URL="http://ipv4.download.thinkbroadband.com/5MB.zip" \
LIMIT_RATE="80K" \
RANGE_BYTES="32768" \
INTERVAL_SECONDS="1" \
MAX_TIME_SECONDS="4" \
CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS="2" \
python scripts/internet_speed_logger.py
```

### API for visualization

- `GET /api/internet-monitor?token=...&limit=120`
- Returns latest sample + recent series ready to chart.
- `GET /api/prices?token=...` now also includes `internet_monitor_history` used by the Raspberry Pi chart (CPU/RAM/Temp/Fan + Internet KB/s line).

### Service (recommended)

The logger runs as systemd service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now status-page-internet-monitor.service
systemctl status --no-pager status-page-internet-monitor.service
```
